          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>Currently, I'm a graduate student, working toward my computer science degree and looking for ways to put my new knowledge and skills to use in a work environment.
            My computer science education combined with previous work experience has given me a great foundation of knowledge and skills. 
            I learn new technologies quickly and apply those abilities to improve the work I do. 
            Additionally, I'm good at computational problem solving, software performance optimization, database management and most of the industry required advanced object-oriented programming languages.
          </p>

          <!-- <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p> -->
