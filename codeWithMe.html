          <p>
            Check out this repository to get a deep insight into advance data querying using SQL over a large dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
              This repository refers to the publicly available IMDB dataset. There are few questions that we can ask to perform analytics over the dataset. 
              Below here are the questions for which the SQL queries has been written.
          </p>
          <p>Q1. Back in 2016, several actors publicly declared they were going to abandon the profession if Trump was elected President. A journalist wishes to retrieve alive actors who acted in more than three movies in 2016 with a runtime of more than 90 minutes, and who have not acted in any movie after 2017.</p>

            <p>Q2. A website wishes to provide a ‘newbie’ prize described as follows: top-25 most productive alive actors in 2021 adult movies who did not act in any adult movie previous to 2021.</p>
            
            <p>Q3.- A video-streaming company focusing on fun, saga movies of the 80s and 90s is deciding on the capacity of hard disks to buy. They are looking for the runtimes of Comedy movies between 1980 and 1999, with ratings greater than 6.5 and total number of votes greater than 10,000 such that there is another posterior movie (but still less or equal than 1999) whose title starts with the current title, where x and y are the aliases of the original and posterior movies, respectively. </p>
            
            <p>Q4.- An organization of Sci-fi fans wishes to create a list with the top-15 most horrible directors: directors of Sci-fi movies sorted by worst average rating such that the directors have directed at least five Sci-fi movies in total, and there are at least 1,000 votes for each movie.</p>
            
            <p>Q5.- To make it more credible, a casting director working on the sequel of Slumdog Millionaire wants to retrieve alive actors whose last name is Patel or Raj who have acted in at least five Drama movies and have not acted in any Comedy movie.</p>
            
            <p>Q6.- There is a new movie directed by Sofia Coppola and starred by Antonio Banderas about terrorism. A journalist wishes to contact people that are known at the same time for movies directed by Sofia Coppola and movies acted by Antonio Banderas.</p>
            
            <p>Q7.- A religious group wishes to invite to its gala dinner alive writers who have written movies whose original titles contain both Jesus and Christ, and their ratings are greater than all the ratings of the movies directed by Edward D. Wood Jr.</p>
            
            <p>Q8.- Researchers are studying the Bechdel test in action movies. They believe it will always fail for movies involving producers of action movies who have produced at least 15 action movies, have never produced any romance movie, and have directed at least one movie of any genre.</p>
            
            <p>Q9.- Steve-o is the largest organization interested in people named ‘Steve.’ They wish to give a $10,000 check to each alive Steve-o person known for at least four Drama or Thriller movies. All these movies must have a single director only. They wish to give an extra check of $5,000 to those top based on the average rating of the movies they are known for.</p>

            The Gradle project here named TNFDecomposition takes a relation , a canonical cover and a set of candidate keys and goes through the step by step process of Third Normal Form Decomposition (Including checking if the relation needs 3NF decomposition in the first place))
