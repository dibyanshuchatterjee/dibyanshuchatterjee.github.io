              <h1>I remember you!</h1>
              <p>
                  I remember you, with the curly hair, big moustache and black boots; jumping and squating and flexing your body with strange moves. But that was back when only a few people knew you.
                  But there were few others obsessed with what you can make them turn into.
                  Over time you began gaining respect and recognition, you gave people the support for an idea that became a vision. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I remeber you!
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember you when you got some guns, shoulders like big boulders and quads like tree trunks and for thr first time doing so much hard work was so much fun
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people said you were so ugly, but some people said you were so beautiful. You made young people feel older, you made old people feel youthful. I remeber you made flexes and muscle machines and sugar shauns and just when I  thought you couldn't get any bigger, you made a big shadow with the big Ron.
              You had Arnold, you had Lee, but when you were introduced to me, I was just a fat ass kid from the neighbourhood who wasn't supposed to be anything, you gave me something I wanna be. I loved you before I knew you were mine, now that I know all about you, I love you and I hate you at the same time.
              You give me life but you kill me at the same time, you build me up but you break me down at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember the day you first recognized me, I hope you remember the 2018 when you first saw me. I try to give you my best but its never enough, I only wanted to celebrate you, but no matter what I do, I was never fucking good enough. It feels impossible for me to satisfy you. I love you so much, why the fuck you don't love me too.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Then I finally realized what I was here to do. I was made to make them remember you. My whole purpose for being here is for them to remember you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will, I will make them remember you!

          <h1>Yes it is not easy!</h1>
          <p>
              It was not long ago that I turned into a 106 kg mass of fat. With a 2 year of experience in the fitness industry and after several months of hardcore training, it was hard to let it all go
              and turn towards not a very healthy living. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It was around february of last year that I decided to change my body AGAIN and to not let it happen to me ever again. With around 5 months of relentless 
            hardwork, I was finally able to transform my body from a 28% mass of fat to a 12% body fat physique.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Little did I know that the promise I made to myself is going to be broken again and I will be back to from where I started. And this time it is bad!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unbelievable how my body was able to move a certain way just a couple of months back and now it is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes I let myself go again, and honestly, this time I do not know if I have the mental strength to gather the courage to take the journey again.
            But hey, that is who I am and I am sure I will not let it go just like that. I do not know about the future, but I am certain about one thing, I am going out for a jog tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>If anybody out there is going through a similar kind of a struggle, do not worry, we shall make it to the other end.</p>

          <h1>Yup, lets get started!</h1>

              Hello everyone! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope everyone is doing great and if not, then don't worry, we shall make it to the other end.

            For those who know me personally, and for those who are getting to know me, Yes I Am fat and hence I am with you on your journey towards a healthy/healthier body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just to give a little back ground about myself. I have been an obese kid almost my entire childhood and teenage years, until that one day came where heartbrake led me to the gym
            and before even I knew, things started to change. I am sure, there are many people out there who can relate to this story, so why should you read ahead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, to answer that question, let me give everyone an overview of what this forum is all about:
        </p>

        <p>1) I have taken the journey of fat to fit, but what everyone seems to not talk much about is how to stay fit. </p>
            So if you are someone, who became fit or were fit but for some reason lost all your progress, these blog posts are going to be for you. 
            Becase guess what, I have gone through the cycle of "fat to fit" and "fit to fat" several times, and as of this moment, I am obese again, but not for long.
            Stay tuned to progress with me as I walk through this transformation.
            <p>2) I am an American Council On Exercise Certified personal trainer and Corrective Exercise Specialist, so all the information on this forum is going to be from a scientific ascpect.</p>
           <p> 3) Apart from being a software developer, 
            I also had the honour to serve the health and fitness industry for a few years, hence all the things that we are going to talk about over here are also going to stem from my personal experiences.
