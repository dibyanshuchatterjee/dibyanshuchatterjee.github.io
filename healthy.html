          <p>
              It was not long ago that I turned into a 106 kg mass of fat. With a 2 year of experience in the fitness industry and after several months of hardcore training, it was hard to let it all go
              and turn towards not a very healthy living. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It was around february of last year that I decided to change my body AGAIN and to not let it happen to me ever again. With around 5 months of relentless 
            hardwork, I was finally able to transform my body from a 28% mass of fat to a 12% body fat physique.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Little did I know that the promise I made to myself is going to be broken again and I will be back to from where I started. And this time it is bad!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unbelievable how my body was able to move a certain way just a couple of months back and now it is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes I let myself go again, and honestly, this time I do not know if I have the mental strength to gather the courage to take the journey again.
            But hey, that is who I am and I am sure I will not let it go just like that. I do not know about the future, but I am certain about one thing, I am going out for a jog tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>If anybody out there is going through a similar kind of a struggle, do not worry, we shall make it to the other end.</p>

              Hello everyone! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope everyone is doing great and if not, then don't worry, we shall make it to the other end.

            For those who know me personally, and for those who are getting to know me, Yes I Am fat and hence I am with you on your journey towards a healthy/healthier body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just to give a little back ground about myself. I have been an obese kid almost my entire childhood and teenage years, until that one day came where heartbrake led me to the gym
            and before even I knew, things started to change. I am sure, there are many people out there who can relate to this story, so why should you read ahead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, to answer that question, let me give everyone an overview of what this forum is all about:
        </p>

        <p>1) I have taken the journey of fat to fit, but what everyone seems to not talk much about is how to stay fit. </p>
            So if you are someone, who became fit or were fit but for some reason lost all your progress, these blog posts are going to be for you. 
            Becase guess what, I have gone through the cycle of "fat to fit" and "fit to fat" several times, and as of this moment, I am obese again, but not for long.
            Stay tuned to progress with me as I walk through this transformation.
            <p>2) I am an American Council On Exercise Certified personal trainer and Corrective Exercise Specialist, so all the information on this forum is going to be from a scientific ascpect.</p>
           <p> 3) Apart from being a software developer, 
            I also had the honour to serve the health and fitness industry for a few years, hence all the things that we are going to talk about over here are also going to stem from my personal experiences.
